		<title>Top 5 worst games ever.</title>
		<h2>5. Superman 64</h2>
		<h2> It's one of those so-bad-it's-good games,
		 The YouTube user ProtonJonSA says of the 1999 Nintendo 64 disaster,
		 before showing us... oh, man... glitches in the game's canned
		 playthrough that the developers thought would get us excited
		 about the game, a terrible storyline synopsis screen, a wretched
		 training level. And it gets worse and worse.</h2>
		<h2>4. Legend of Zelda wand of Gamelon.</h2>
		<h2>Okay, let me start this off by saying that you should
		not even be reading this one. Here is something better
		for you to read: a book, or perhaps even nothing at all.
		You should be able to tell by looking at the synopsis and
		score that this video game is terribly horrible. This game
		is just plain horrible. Actually, as a matter - of - fact,
		this video game is even worse than horrible. It is totally
		and completely disastrous. I would want more than anything
		right now, to end the review right here and now, but unfortunately
		I have to use at least four hundred words in a review.
		If you still insist on reading it, be my guest. 
First of all, I would like to say I never had this video game,
and I never had a CD-I. I played this game at a friendâ€™s house, and
I have no idea why he actually wanted to consider getting this horrible
video game, let alone buy it. He must have been brainwashed or something
similar to that. </h2>
